# Goal Digr

Goal Digr is a tree-based goal-setting app. Define a high-level goal and break that goal down into sub-goals. Then break those sub-goals down into sub-sub-goals... and on and on.

The purpose of goal breakdown is to help you find your immediate next actions. Goals, especially big ones, are hard to act upon because they're so abstract. "Increase my income by $10,000" doesn't tell you what to *do*.

But if you break goals down into smaller bits, eventually you reach something bite-sized enough to be actionable.
